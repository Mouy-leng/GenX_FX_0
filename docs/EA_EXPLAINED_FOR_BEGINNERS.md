# 🤖 EA Script Explained for Complete Beginners

## 🎯 **What is This EA Script?**

Your EA script is like a **trading robot** that:
1. **Reads signals** from your Google VM
2. **Decides when to trade** based on those signals
3. **Places trades automatically** on your broker account
4. **Manages risk** so you don't lose everything

---

## 🔧 **The Important Settings You MUST Understand**

When you put the EA on a chart, you'll see these settings. Here's what each one means **IN SIMPLE TERMS**:

### 📁 **CSVFileName = "MT4_Signals.csv"**
**What it means**: Where the robot looks for trading instructions
**What you do**: Leave this as is - don't change it
**Why**: This is the file your VM creates with trading signals

### 💰 **RiskPercent = 2.0**
**What it means**: How much of your money to risk per trade
**Example**: 
- You have $1000 in your account
- Set to 2.0 = Risk $20 per trade
- Set to 1.0 = Risk $10 per trade
- Set to 0.5 = Risk $5 per trade
**What you do**: START WITH 1.0 (1%) - be safe!

### 🎯 **MagicNumber = 123450**
**What it means**: A unique ID so the robot doesn't mess with your manual trades
**What you do**: Change this to any number you like (like your birthday: 19850315)
**Why**: If you have multiple robots, each needs different number

### 🔒 **EnableTrading = true**
**What it means**: 
- true = Actually make trades (spend real money)
- false = Just show what it WOULD do (no money spent)
**What you do**: Start with "false" to test, then change to "true"

### 📊 **MaxTrades = 5**
**What it means**: Maximum number of trades open at the same time
**What you do**: Start with 3 - don't let it open 20 trades at once!

### ⏰ **CheckInterval = 30**
**What it means**: How often (in seconds) the robot checks for new signals
**What you do**: 30 seconds is perfect - don't make it 1 second!

---

## 🔄 **How The EA Actually Works**

### **Step 1: Robot Wakes Up**
```
EA starts → "Hello, I'm ready to trade!"
```

### **Step 2: Robot Checks for Instructions**
```
Every 30 seconds → Opens "MT4_Signals.csv" → Reads new trading signals
```

### **Step 3: Robot Decides What to Do**
```
Signal says "BUY EURUSD" → Robot calculates position size → Places buy order
```

### **Step 4: Robot Manages the Trade**
```
Sets stop loss → Sets take profit → Watches the trade → Closes when needed
```

## 📂 **What You Need to Set Up (Step by Step)**

### **Step 1: Get the Signal File to Your Computer**

Your signals are here: `http://34.71.143.222:8080/MT4_Signals.csv`

**Option A - Manual Download (Easy)**:
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: `http://34.71.143.222:8080/MT4_Signals.csv`
3. Save the file to your computer
4. Copy it to MetaTrader's Files folder

**Option B - Automatic Download (Better)**:
Create a small script that downloads it every 5 minutes.

### **Step 2: Find Your MetaTrader Files Folder**

1. Open MetaTrader 4
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + D` (this opens the data folder)
3. Go to: `MQL4` → `Experts` (for EA file)
4. Go to: `MQL4` → `Files` (for CSV signal file)

### **Step 3: Copy Files to Right Places**

```
📁 Your Computer Structure:
MetaTrader/
├── MQL4/
│   ├── Experts/
│   │   └── MT4_GenX_EA_Example.mq4  ← Put EA here
│   └── Files/
│       └── MT4_Signals.csv          ← Put signals here
```

### **Step 4: Configure EA Settings**

When you drag EA to chart, you'll see a window with settings:

```
🔧 SAFE BEGINNER SETTINGS:
✅ CSVFileName = "MT4_Signals.csv"    (don't change)
✅ RiskPercent = 1.0                  (1% risk - safe!)
✅ MagicNumber = 20250128             (your own number)
✅ EnableTrading = false              (test mode first!)
✅ MaxTrades = 3                      (only 3 trades max)
✅ CheckInterval = 30                 (check every 30 sec)
```

---

## 🚨 **Critical Things You MUST Know**

### **Testing Mode vs Live Mode**

**ALWAYS START WITH TESTING:**
```
EnableTrading = false  → EA shows what it WOULD do (no money spent)
EnableTrading = true   → EA actually trades (money at risk!)
```

### **Risk Management**
```
Account Size: $1000
RiskPercent = 1.0  → Risk $10 per trade  ← SAFE
RiskPercent = 5.0  → Risk $50 per trade  ← DANGEROUS
RiskPercent = 10.0 → Risk $100 per trade ← VERY DANGEROUS
```

### **Broker Compatibility**
✅ **Works with ANY MT4/MT5 broker:**
- Exness
- IC Markets
- XM
- FTMO
- Your local broker
