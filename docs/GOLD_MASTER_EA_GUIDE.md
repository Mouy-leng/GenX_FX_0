```

### **💰 Risk Management:**
```
BaseRiskPercent = 1.0               ← Base risk per trade
MaxRiskPerTrade = 5.0              ← Safety cap (never risk more than 5%)
MaxTotalRisk = 15.0                ← Total risk across all trades
MaxTradesPerPair = 2               ← Max 2 trades per gold pair
MaxTotalTrades = 6                 ← Max 6 total trades at once
```

### **🎯 Confidence-Based Risk Scaling:**
```

HighConfidenceLevel = 85.0         ← 2.5x risk at 85%+
VeryHighConfidenceLevel = 90.0     ← 4x risk at 90%+
MaxConfidenceRiskMultiplier = 4.0  ← Maximum risk multiplier
```

### **🔄 Advanced Strategy:**
```
EnableBackupStrategy = true        ← Use backup when VM fails
EnableVolatilityFilter = true      ← Adjust risk based on volatility
VolatilityPeriod = 14             ← ATR period for volatility

```

## 🎯 **Risk Scaling Examples**

### **How Confidence Affects Risk:**
```
VM Signal: XAUGBP BUY, Confidence 90%
Base Risk: 1%
Applied Risk: 4% (1% × 4.0 multiplier)
Account: $10,000
Risk Amount: $400 per trade

VM Signal: XAUEUR SELL, Confidence 85%  
Base Risk: 1%
Applied Risk: 2.5% (1% × 2.5 multiplier)
Account: $10,000
Risk Amount: $250 per trade

VM Signal: XAUUSD BUY, Confidence 80%
Base Risk: 1%
Applied Risk: 1.5% (1% × 1.5 multiplier)
Account: $10,000
Risk Amount: $150 per trade
```

### **Safety Caps Applied:**
```
If calculated risk > MaxRiskPerTrade (5%):
→ Risk is capped at 5% maximum

If total risk across all trades > MaxTotalRisk (15%):
→ EA stops opening new trades
```
